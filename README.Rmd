# R genlogis

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/genlogis)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=genlogis)

This package provides basic distribution functions for a generalized logistic distribution proposed by Rathie and Swamee (2006) <https://www.rroij.com/open-access/on-new-generalized-logistic-distributions-and-applicationsbarreto-fhs-mota-jma-and-rathie-pn-.pdf>. 
It also has an interactive 'RStudio' plot for better guessing dynamically of initial values for ease of included optimization and simulating.

It was build as an academic work at University of Brasília (UnB) with the supervision of Dr. Eduardo Monteiro.

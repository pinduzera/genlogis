Description: Provides basic distribution functions for a generalized logistic distribution proposed by Rathie and Swamee (2006) <https://www.rroij.com/open-access/on-new-generalized-logistic-distributions-and-applicationsbarreto-fhs-mota-jma-and-rathie-pn-.pdf>. It also has an interactive 'RStudio' plot for better guessing dynamically of initial values for ease of included optimization and simulating.
